//! Collect [Tracy] profiles in tracing-enabled applications.
//!
//! Assuming the application is well instrumented, this should in practice be a very low effort way
//! to gain great amounts of insight into an application performance.
//!
//! Note, however that Tracy is ultimately a profiling, not an observability, tool. As thus, some
//! of tracing concepts cannot be represented well by Tracy. For instance, out-of-order span
//! entries and exits, are not supported, and neither are spans that are entered and exited on
//! different threads. This crate will attempt to mitigate the problems and retain trace validity
//! at the cost of potentially invalid data. When such a mitigation occurs, trace will contain a
//! message with a note about the problem.
//!
//! Some other caveats to keep in mind:
//!
//! * Only span entries and exits are recorded;
//! * Events show up as messages in Tracy, however Tracy can struggle with large numbers of
//! messages;
//! * Some additional functionality such as plotting and memory allocation profiling is only
//! available as part of the [tracy-client](tracy_client) crate.
//!
//! # Important note
//!
//! Unlike with many other subscriber implementations, simply depending on this crate is sufficient
//! for tracy to be enabled at program startup, even if [`TracyLayer`](TracyLayer) is not
//! registered as a subscriber. While not registering a `TracyLayer` will avoid Tracy from
//! collecting spans, it still broadcasts discovery packets to the local network and exposes the
//! data it collects in the background to that same network. Traces collected by Tracy may include
//! source and assembly code as well.
//!
//! As thus, you may want make sure to only enable the `tracing-tracy` crate conditionally, via the
//! `enable` feature flag provided by this crate.
